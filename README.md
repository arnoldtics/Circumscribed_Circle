## Information about installation and execution
All the code was written in Python 3.10.7. Before cloning the repository, check if your Python version is compatible with this program.
Also, make sure to install (if you don't have them) all the modules that were used for this proyect (numpy and matplolib). 
After that, you just have to clone this repository on your local machine and run the archive named "Circumscribed_Circle.py" in the terminal of your preference.
You can run the program the number of times you want. But, it will generate different coordinate points every single time. That is the reason why I recommend saving every graph you get.

## Introduction


## Objectives
- Create a set of functions which can construct the lines and the circumscribed circle from three random coordinate points.
- Plot the lines and circle in a good resolution and minimizing the margin of rendering error.

## Metodology

## Implementation

## Tests and results

## Conclusions
Working with random coordinates points can be hard beacause it is imposible to set a good scale for the render of all the executions. Nevertheless, the final result was a success. The render is fast and the curves are smooth enough. The margin of rendering error is close to 0.00001 between the points and the circle.
Future work can be focused on developing faster rendering tools and making statistics about the margin of rendering error
